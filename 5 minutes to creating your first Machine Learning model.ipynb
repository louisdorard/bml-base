    "# 5 minutes to creating your first Machine Learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a number of services out there that make Machine Learning accessible to the masses by abstracting away the complexities of creating predictive models from data. Here I want to show you how to use one of them, [BigML](https://bigml.com), through its API, in order to create a real estate pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that you're given characteristics of a real estate property (e.g. number of bedrooms, surface, year of construction, etc.) and you input these into a \"model\" that will predict the property's value. To create this model, we'll just need to use some [example real-estate data that I've scraped from realtor.com using Import.io](http://blog.import.io/post/become-a-data-scientist-in-an-hour). The data contains 4776 rows (one per example property), it's available to [download as a CSV file](https://bml-data.s3.amazonaws.com/realtor-las-vegas.csv) or to [browse on Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X7-xvzAx5d7aS6ZcTcNaUEH23ZWmB7vuGXYQ03B3yP8/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we'll see how to upload the data to BigML, which will automatically create a predictive model, and how to query this model with any given set of real estate property characteristics. Check out [this blog post if you want to understand what happens behind the scenes, how Machine Learning works, and when it fails to work](https://louis-dorard.squarespace.com/blog/when-machine-learning-fails) (http://louisdorard.com/blog/when-machine-learning-fails).\n",
